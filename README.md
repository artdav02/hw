# My Web App Implementation

## Introduction
This is my web app implementation! My first experience with both back and front went interesting! Hope you will like it!

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js (Note: This was a challenging choice!)
- **Database:** MySQL

## Database Credentials
Find the database credentials in the `.env` file.

## Project Setup

### Activating the Backend Server
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd hw-backend
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

### Activating the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd hw-frontend
   ```
2. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Admin User Credentials
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin

## Development Notes
I made all the frontend and backend by myself without templates, so it took a lot of time. Hope I got the task right! And I will also expand the project a little, because I really enjoyed the idea of it!
